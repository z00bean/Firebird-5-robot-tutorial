# Firebird_5
Basic C programs (AVR) for Fire Bird 5

These programs were written by the Tezpur Universoty team during the hands on sessions of the Two day workshop on Introduction to Robotics organized by Tezpur University and e-Yantra, IIT Bombay.

The programs are crude, messy and far from being perfect!!
